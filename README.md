- **data** : contains GLS data and others (metadata, world shape ...)
- **figure** : contains figure of the manuscript
- **results** : contains wavelet analysis for each individual with one .html and one .RData as a result of each analysis
- **toolbox** : contains a set of R functions needed for the analysis

Individual analysis are conducted through the notebook *WaveLightGLS.Rmd* for each individual.

Global analysis are conducted in the files *Figure_1_and_2.R*, *Figure_3.R*, and *Figure_4.R*
